A few days ago I started using [Dash](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dash-docs-snippets/id458034879?mt=12) to view developer documentation. I was immediately blown away by how insanely fast it was. It has quickly become my go-to app for searching and reading documentation. Today I found myself wishing it had better Xcode integration so I checked if the Dash developers had included a system service.

Success! Now I can simply highlight something in Xcode, hit control+command+L and have it brought it up in Dash.




If you haven't gotten [Dash](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dash-docs-snippets/id458034879?mt=12) yet, go get it, it's awesome.





By the way, did you see what I did with the title there? Pretty clever, huh?
