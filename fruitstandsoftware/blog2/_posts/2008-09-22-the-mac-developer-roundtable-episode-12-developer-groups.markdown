If you're a fan of [Scotty's podcasts](http://www.mac-developer-network.com/podcasts/) (though who isn't, I mean really...) and you think you can stand to listen to me and 6 other guys ramble on about developer groups for 1 hour, 34 minutes and 4 seconds head on over to [Mac-Developer-Network.com](http://www.mac-developer-network.com/) and download [the latest episode of The Mac Developer Roundtable](http://www.mac-developer-network.com/blog/?id=3469474814738280918).




I was lucky enough to be joined by a great crew of developers: [Scotty](http://www.mamooba.com/) (of course), [Jiva DeVoe](http://www.random-ideas.net/), [Joe Heck](http://www.rhonabwy.com/wp/), [Paul Kim](http://www.noodlesoft.com/blog/), [Dave Verwer](http://shinydevelopment.com/) and [Jonathan "Wolf" Rentzsch](http://rentzsch.com/).




This is my second time recording a podcast with Scotty and I think I did a lot better than my first outing.  Hopefully Scotty still feels that I'm a worthwhile guest and I'll get to polish my skills a bit more in the future.
