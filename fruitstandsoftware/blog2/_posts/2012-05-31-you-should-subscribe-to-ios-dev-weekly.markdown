My good friend [Dave Verwer](http://twitter.com/daveverwer) has taken it upon himself to keep the iOS development community informed of the latest and greatest happenings, [one](http://iosdevweekly.com/issues/43/) [weekly](http://iosdevweekly.com/issues/42/) [newsletter](http://iosdevweekly.com/issues/41/) [at](http://iosdevweekly.com/issues/40/) [a](http://iosdevweekly.com/issues/39/) [time](http://iosdevweekly.com/issues/38/).

Each newsletter is concise, easily digestible, and always contains at _least_ one link that I want to read. If you're not already subscribed you should head over to [iosdevweekly.com](http://iosdevweekly.com/), put your email address in the box, and click **Subscribe**.
