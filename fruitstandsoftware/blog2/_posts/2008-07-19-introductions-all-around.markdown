Since this is the first post on the new Fruit Stand Software blog I suppose I should take a few words to introduce myself and tell you what I hope to accomplish:

My name is Michael Fey and I am a coder, a longtime Mac user, and a self-proclaimed geek.

My plan is to use this blog to post news about my Cocoa programming exploits, things I learn how to do, topics that we cover at CocoaHeads, and links to posts on other sites that I find useful.

That's it, that's all I'm writing here for now. I don't want this to become a long-winded explanation about why you should read my blog because if I'm doing my job right than its content should answer that question for me.
