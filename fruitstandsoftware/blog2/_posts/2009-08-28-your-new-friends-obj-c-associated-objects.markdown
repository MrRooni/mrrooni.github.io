Andy Matuschak has posted a little-known feature of the Objective-C API under Snow Leopard on his blog.  I can't think of a use for associated objects at the moment, but there's a good chance that I will need them in the future.  You can read about them at his blog: [Square Signals : Your New Friends: Obj-C Associated Objects](http://blog.andymatuschak.org/post/173646741/your-new-friends-obj-c-associated-objects).
