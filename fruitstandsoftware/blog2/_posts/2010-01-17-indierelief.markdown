For those that may not have heard, [Justin Williams](http://twitter.com/justin) has organized a great effort to provide financial relief to the people of Haiti. Set to take place throughout the day on January 20th, all the proceeds from the sale of participating software will be donated to Haiti. We here at [No Thirst Software](http://www.nothirst.com/) are participating with sales of [MoneyWell](http://www.nothirst.com/moneywell/) and [Debt Quencher](http://www.nothirst.com/debtquencher/). For a full list of participating software please check out theÂ [Indie+Relief](http://www.indierelief.com/) website.

It's a great cause and I know that I will be checking the list for software that's on my "to buy" list. I suggest that you do the same.
