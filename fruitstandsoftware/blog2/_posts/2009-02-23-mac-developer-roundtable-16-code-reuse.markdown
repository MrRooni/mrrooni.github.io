[![macdeveloperroundtable](http://fruitstandsoftware.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/blocks_image_0_1.png)](http://fruitstandsoftware.com/blog/2008/07/mac-developer-roundtable/blocks_image_0_1/)I had the good fortune of recording another episode of the Mac Developer Roundtable a few weeks ago and that episode is now live on the Mac Developer Network site.

We have a rousing discussion on code reuse and all its pluses and minuses,  I highly recommend giving it a listen.

This episode is free, but the Mac Developer Network also provides a large amount of fantastic premium content including video training courses, free software, software discounts, plus access to other podcasts that are not available to non-members.  Head on over to MDN's [Why Join?](http://www.mac-developer-network.com/membership/) page to find out more.

For those of you who aren't subscribed to the MDR feed through iTunes, here is a direct link to episode 16: [Mac Developer Network  » Blog Archive  » MDR016: Code Reuse](http://www.mac-developer-network.com/podcasts/mdr/mdr016/).
