If you haven't heard, the second annual [WWDC Photo Walk is set for Wednesday June 12th at 6:15 PM](http://www.fruitstandsoftware.com/blog/2013/05/wwdc-2013-photo-walk/). If you'd like to sponsor the walk I'd love to have you on board. Now you may be asking yourself, "Sponsorship? What costs are associated with a photo walk?" Well that's the beauty of it, there are none! Sponsorship in this case means having your product or company name listed in the walk details, promoted on the [WWDC Photo Walk Twitter account](http://twitter.com/wwdcphotowalk), and promoted within the [WWDC Photo Walk Glassboard](https://app.glassboard.com/web/invitation/code/nyzzu) in exchange for some promo codes or discounts given out to the walk participants. 

For instance, last year we had [500px sponsor us](http://www.fruitstandsoftware.com/blog/2012/06/wwdc-2012-photo-walk/) with one Awesome and one Plus account for the two folks [whose photos were the best](http://www.fruitstandsoftware.com/blog/2012/06/wwdc-2012-photo-walk-wrap-up/).

So if you're interested please send me an email at michael at this domain and we'll get the ball rolling.
