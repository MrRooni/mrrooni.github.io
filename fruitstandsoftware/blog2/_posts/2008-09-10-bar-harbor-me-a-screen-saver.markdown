A couple of years ago I whipped up a photo screen saver bundle from some photos that I took while my wife and I were on our second honeymoon.  I've always meant to release it, but have just not gotten around to whipping up a download page for it or uploading it to MacUpdate or Apple Downloads.




That being said, I've decided to provide it here for now, just to get it into a few folks hands and maybe even gather some feedback on it.  It's a doozy of a download (47.3 MB) but it contains 12 high resolution photos in and around Bar Harbor.




Grab it here: [BarHarborME.slideSaver.tbz](http://fruitstandsoftware.com/BarHarborME.slideSaver.tbz) and let me know what you think.
