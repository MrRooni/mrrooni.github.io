I recently acquired a free license of [Typinator](http://www.macility.com/products/typinator/) through [MacHeist](http://www.macheist.com/) and have been loving it.  I put together a set of abbreviations for the text macros that  Xcode provides and it has made my coding life much easier.  A few folks have asked why I'm not using xctxtmacros and the truth is that I didn't know about them.  Either way, Typinator is working great.

You can download my set of [Xcode Abbreviations here](http://fruitstandsoftware.com/blog/?attachment_id=212).  Please note that it's extremely limited as I only included those macros that I need most often.  Leave a comment if there are any that you think I'm missing.
