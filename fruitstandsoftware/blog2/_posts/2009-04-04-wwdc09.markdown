[![WWDC09Badge](http://fruitstandsoftware.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/home_tracks_buy20090324.png)](http://fruitstandsoftware.com/blog/2009/04/wwdc09/home_tracks_buy20090324/)I am happy to report that I will be attending WWDC this year! Â It will be my first time at the conference and I couldn't be more excited.

I'm looking forward to "drinking from the fire hose of knowledge", meeting all the great developers that I look up to, having drinks with friends that I've only met online, and soaking up as much knowledge as humanly possible in a 5-day period.

If you're also going to be out there feel free to drop me a line on twitter or leave a comment below!
