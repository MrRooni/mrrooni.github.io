That's right, I want to win a Drobo, and I'm more than willing to use my blog to win one.  Here's the deal:


> Hey would you like to win a Drobo? All you have to do is link from your blog or website to [MYDL.ME](http://mydl.me/). That's it - must be 18 and live in a country where Drobo ships to be eligible. We're going to pick a winner on March 31 so get your link up now. We're going to check our referral logs to pick the winner. Good luck. -- P.S. If you don't win but you'd like a good deal on a Drobo check this out. If you want to buy a 2nd Generation Drobo populated with four WD 1TB Green Drives for $849, you can. Just use the code MYDL849 at the [Drobostore](http://www.Drobostore.com/)--Valid through 3/31/09.


Now that post says that the drawing and coupon are only good until 3/31 and of course it is now 4/17, but [@drobo](http://www.twitter.com/drobo) did post this tweet last night:


> Picking the lucky DroboPro winner this Fri. Just follow [@scottbourne](http://www.twitter.com/scottbourne), or link to [http://www.mydl.me](http://www.mydl.me) to play, and see who's won. Please RT.


So I'm holding out hope.  Cheers!
