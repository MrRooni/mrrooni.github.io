![unitedlemurlogo](http://fruitstandsoftware.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/unitedlemurlogo-300x300.png)The past few weeks have been quite the whirlwind of activity here at Camp Fruit Stand, and I have some exciting news: I am now an intern at [United Lemur](http://unitedlemur.org/), working on an iPhone game for them, and loving every minute of it.

As I look back at the date on my last post I'm not surprised that it's been over a month since I last had a chance to put anything into print.  Any free time that I have had has been spent either working on the house or reading the [developer documentation from Apple](https://developer.apple.com/iphone/) on how to write software for the iPhone.

Even though I'm the "new guy" everyone has welcomed me with open arms and instantly made me feel like a member of the team.  From day one I was given a new name (I am now known as Mike McChristopher among my fellow lemurs), a new email address, and full responsibility for a project that will result in another great United Lemur app in the App Store.

It has also been fantastic to be behind the scenes in the troop's chat room as their initial foray, [Puzzllotto](http://puzzllotto.com/), has played out and to watch as they prep their next big thing.

I think one of the best things about having the opportunity to join this troop is that I am part of an incredibly talented group of developers, designers, and engineers that aren't just doing this to get rich.  Something great happens to a person when they are exposed to others in their field that are so obviously passionate about what they do.

I'd also like to take a few words to thank [Mike Lee](http://atomicwang.org/motherfucker/).  From the beginning Mike has been one of the nicest, most easy going, easily approachable guys I've ever had the pleasure to meet.  He has given me an incredible opportunity by allowing me to join him in his crusade to save the lemurs and for that I thank him.

Now don't worry, I will still be creating new posts here (in fact I've got a couple in the queue already), but be warned: my future posts might have a bit of lemur scent on them.
