For those of you waiting for the next great thing in Cocoa development podcasts I humbly submit [cocoaFusion:](http://www.cocoafusion.net/).




[cocoaFusion:](http://www.cocoafusion.net/) is hosted by Kevin Hoctor of [MoneyWell](http://nothirst.com/moneywell/) fame, and Danny Greg the lead developer on [Realmac Software](http://www.realmacsoftware.com/)'s most recent release, [LittleSnapper](http://www.realmacsoftware.com/littlesnapper/).  The pair decided to start a podcast of their own after being introduced on one of [Scotty's](http://twitter.com/macdevnet) excellent [Mac Developer Network](http://www.mac-developer-network.com/) shows.




The idea behind [cocoaFusion:](http://www.cocoafusion.net/) is for each Kevin and Danny to cover a coding problem that they've faced down since the last episode.  The first episode has Kevin relating his experiences with [NSDateFormatter](http://developer.apple.com/DOCUMENTATION/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSDateFormatter_Class/index.html) while Danny goes in depth on [NSPredicateEditor](http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/NSPredicateEditor_class/index.html).




While the pair admits to some rough edges in the first episode, the overall quality of the show's production and the ease with which Danny and Kevin relate to each other makes for a fantastic show that's a pleasure to listen to.
