I was fortunate enough to be invited by [Steve Scott (Scotty)](http://www.mac-developer-network.com/) to be on [the latest Mac Developer Roundtable podcast](http://www.mac-developer-network.com/podcasts/macdeveloperroundtable/episode10/index.html) with [Danny Greg](http://dannygreg.com/) and [Marcus Zarra](http://www.cimgf.com/).  We recorded for 3 hours and it was a ton of fun (don't worry, the edited version was only 1.5 hours long).  We covered a wide range of topics from the new iPhone, new technologies and how and why we use them, how Windows programmers view our development tools and the usual round of "developer picks".




If you're a Mac developer and are not currently subscribed to [The Mac Developer Network podcasts](http://www.mac-developer-network.com/podcasts/) I highly recommend heading over to Scotty's site and checking it out.  Scotty is a fantastic and gracious host and runs a great podcast.
