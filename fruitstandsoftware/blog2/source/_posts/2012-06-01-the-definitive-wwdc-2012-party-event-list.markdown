If you're going to be in San Francisco during WWDC make sure you check out the [Definitive WWDC’12 Party & Event List](http://macindie.com/2012/05/the-definitive-wwdc12-party-event-list/) over on [macindie.com](http://macindie.com/). These guys really stay on top of everything that's happening during the week and it's a great resource for keeping up with the myriad events. You should pay particular attention to Wednesday, it looks like [someone](http://twitter.com/MrRooni) scheduled an awesome [photography-related event](http://www.fruitstandsoftware.com/blog/2012/06/wwdc-2012-photo-walk/).
