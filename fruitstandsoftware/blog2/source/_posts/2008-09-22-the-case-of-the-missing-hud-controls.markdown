With the advent of Leopard Apple made some significant upgrades to the library of UI controls that it makes available to developers through Interface Builder.  One of the more lauded controls was the inclusion of the HUD Window.

The celebration over the inclusion of this flavor of NSPanel was quickly followed with confusion and anger over Apple's apparent incompetence to deliver any of the standard controls in a HUD flavor.  Apparently someone got tired of waiting for Apple to realize their mistake and decided to just whip up their own versions instead.
