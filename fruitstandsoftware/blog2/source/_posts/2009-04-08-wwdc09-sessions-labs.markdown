Apple has posted the first set of scheduled sessions and labs for this year's WWDC here: [Worldwide Developers Conference 2009 - Sessions & Labs](http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/sessions/).

Off the top of my head I think I will be keeping an eye on:



	
  * Advanced Debugging

	
  * Cocoa Tips and Tricks

	
  * Concurrent Programming in Cocoa

	
  * Effective iPhone App Architecture

	
  * Embedding Maps in iPhone Applications

	
  * Performance Tuning with Shark on Mac and iPhone

	
  * User Interface Design for iPhone Apps


Which ones do you have your eyes on?
