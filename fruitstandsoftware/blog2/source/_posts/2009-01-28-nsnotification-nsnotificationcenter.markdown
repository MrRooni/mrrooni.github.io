Below you will find the slides and accompanying sample project that I presented at the January 2008 CocoaHeads meeting in Syracuse, NY.  I posted both the Keynote presentation and the PDF export of said presentation.  Because it was an informal gathering I decided to use a few of the Keynote transitions that are fun, but maybe a little over the top.  If this kind of thing bugs you, rock out the PDF version, it just has the slides.

Also, during the meeting a few folks asked about playing sounds and doing speech synthesis, so you will see simple examples of those technologies used in the sample project as well.
