I am continually amazed how some of the most basic design changes can have profound results.


> It's hard to imagine a form that could be simpler: two fields, two buttons, and one link. Yet, it turns out this form was preventing customers from purchasing products from a major e-commerce site, to the tune of $300,000,000 a year. What was even worse: the designers of the site had no clue there was even a problem.


I was blown away by the revelation that of the 160,000 people that were requesting lost passwords every day only 25% of those people ever came back to complete their order.
