# The Long Winded Version


During WWDC we have an awesome opportunity to get together with other photo geeks and make some great photos of one of the coolest cities in the world. As such, I figured it would be cool to organize a photo walk. We'll meet up on the [street at the Powell Street BART](http://goo.gl/maps/AW4G) at 6:30 on Wednesday, June 13th. There are usually a good number of street performers around so it should make for a great location to wait while everyone shows up. Shortly thereafter we'll head [down Market Street towards the Ferry Building](http://goo.gl/maps/lMXI) and then see where the winds take us.

Sunset is at [8:33PM](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/astronomy.html?n=224&month=6&year=2012&obj=sun&afl=-11&day=1) and between San Francisco Bay and the Oakland Bay Bridge we should be able to make some great photos (if we decide to stay out that long).

There's no need to RSVP, but it'd be great to know if you're coming so please send me a message on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/MrRooni) or an email to michael at this domain.
