This morning I [posted a screenshot of my Interface Builder layout on Twitter](http://twitter.com/MrRooni/status/2515282668).  I didn't think much of it at the time, but I received [enough](http://twitter.com/HeroicAutobot/status/2515335910) [positive](http://twitter.com/pbur/status/2515400970) [feedback](http://twitter.com/tesseractor/status/2515566160) on it that I decided to post it here for generations of future Cocoa developers to find.  The layout gets harder to work with the smaller your screen gets, but it works very well on my 24" display.  Another tip for working well with IB: keep it in it's own space and don't let other apps invade that space.  I find that when I can concentrate just on my IB windows without having to mentally block out background windows it makes my workflow much smoother.
